            Prasanna's Performance
        </h1>
        <p class="headingg">Well, I'm grateful to Brijesh Sir, for giving me the opportunity to work with Signatures. I have been through a lot and this one opportunity has changed my life so much. That I'll be forever grateful to the team including the management in believing in me selecting me to work with Signatures. Since the time I came in, there have been constant love and support from each and everyone. I started with the low grade performance when I initially started. It took me a while to remember all what I've learnt and work my real potential with whatever the projects that were assigned to me. Then days went by, I also had anger issues, at times I would burst out my emotions at people around. So, that was one of my bad behavior in me. Then I went and spoke to Mano, we worked on it on daily basis and it turned out for me that I've overcome it with great success. Me communicating with the team is now excellent. When speaking of my work, I am feeling super proud of myself to where I've grown. I would always give my best.</p>
