            Prasanna's Project Report / Evaluation
        </h1>
        <p class="headingg">Well, I'm grateful to Brijesh Sir, for giving me the opportunity to work with Signatures. I have been through a lot and this one opportunity has changed my life so much. That I'll be forever grateful to the team including the management in believing in me selecting me to work with Signatures. Since the time I came in, there have been constant love and support from each and everyone. I started with the low grade performance when I initially started. It took me a while to remember all what I've learnt and work my real potential with whatever the projects that were assigned to me. Then days went by, I also had anger issues, at times I would burst out my emotions at people around. So, that was one of my bad behavior in me. Then I went and spoke to Mano, we worked on it on daily basis and it turned out for me that I've overcome it with great success. Me communicating with the team is now excellent. When speaking of my work, I am feeling super proud of myself to where I've grown. I would always give my best.</p>

                    <p>The time I joined the Company, this has been the first project that has been handed to me. Since I had no touch to whatever I learnt previously. It took me nearly 6 months and also due to the delay of contents from the client it took me so long in getting this project completed.

                    <p>The tool that I used in this project was webflow. It is one of the new tool that I encountered for this project. The design that I got was pretty complicated and I decided to take up this challenge and do my best. I did work really hard on it and learnt the tool and completed the project in 18 days time. I am happy for what I have done with the limited contents that I've got from the team. </p>

                    <p>CMK was one of my first project on WordPress, when it comes to commercial this was my first ever project that I'm working with WordPress. It was quite challenging initially because I am not used to working with this tool previously.  It took me 2 weeks time in completing the project and did my best for this project as a fresher.

                    <p>This was quite an interesting project. I took this once I was done with CMK. I was so happy to see my progress as I was enjoying working with new challenges daily. I had some difficulties when I started, but then I did find someway in figuring out all those answers and getting it done was one of the best thing and I somehow managed to complete the project in 10 days time.

                    <p>By the time, when I started with CACPL, I was pretty good at WordPress. So the design was also an impressive stuff where I was so happy in getting it done. I did complete that project in half-a-day because the client was in a hurry to get this project to em. So just got it done when I was asked. It was one of my first ever project since I joined the company to complete the project in short span of time.

                    <p>I took nearly 5 days in completing the homepage design.

Later on, once I was done with the homepage design, I taught Prithika, the design for the inner pages I did some inner pages and also thought her how to do. She did complete the project then in another week or so
